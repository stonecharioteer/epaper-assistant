# epaper-assistant

This is a flask-webserver based application to manage
my Raspberry Pi3 and its epaper screen.

I'm using a WaveShare 2.7" e-ink screen with three supported color tones.

This application allows me to use the epaper screen anywhere.

## Feature Wishlist:

    * Broadcast IP(s) on the screen.
    * Write service that starts on boot.
    * Provide a web application that can be accessed via the IP
    broadcasted on the screen.
    * If a Wi-Fi or other kind of network is not available, initiate a 
    Wi-Fi network, run a dhcp server and a minimal dns.
    * Provide a "screensaver", detect when the screen is "idle" and show the fortune.
    * Allow modules to be added, such as the `nakama` script, and others.
    * Provide a GUI-based way to show something on the screen.
